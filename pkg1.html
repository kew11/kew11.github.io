<div style="color: #52A3CC;">
Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust with an 
average abundance of approximately 5 Î¼g/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, 
mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, 
only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major
precious metal commodity.

Platinum is the least reactive metal. It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and is therefore 
considered a noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. 
Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives.
