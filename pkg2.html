Gold is a element in its purest form, is bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. 
Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, 
and is solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental form, as nuggets or grains, 
in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver and 
also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. 
<br>
This metal has been a valuable and highly sought-after precious metal for coinage, jewelry, and other arts since long 
before the beginning of recorded history. In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy within 
and between nations, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency
