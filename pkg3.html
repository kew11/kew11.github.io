<div style="color:#1FAD99;">
Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. More abundant than gold, silver metal has in many premodern 
monetary systems functioned as coinable specie, sometimes even alongside gold. In addition, silver has numerous 
applications beyond currency, such as in solar panels, water filtration, jewelry and ornaments, high-value 
tableware and also as an investment in the forms of coins and bullion.

Silver is used industrially in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings and 
in catalysis of chemical reactions. Its compounds are used in photographic film and X-rays. 
Dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides 
added to bandages and wound-dressings, catheters and other medical instruments.
